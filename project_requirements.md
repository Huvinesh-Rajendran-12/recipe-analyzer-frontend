Overview
Build a Smart Recipe Analyzer web application that allows users to input a list of ingredients and receive recipe suggestions with nutritional analysis using AI.
Requirements
Frontend (React/Vue/Vanilla JS)
Input Form: Text area for users to enter available ingredients (comma-separated)
Results Display: Show generated recipes with ingredients, instructions, and nutritional info
Loading States: Visual feedback during API calls
Responsive Design: Works on desktop and mobile
Error Handling: Display user-friendly error messages
Backend (Node.js/Python/Any)
Request validation: Ensure ingredients list is not empty
LLM Integration: Connect to OpenAI, Anthropic, or any LLM API
Response formatting: Structure the LLM response consistently
LLM Integration Requirements
Prompt Engineering: Create a structured prompt that asks the LLM to:
Generate 2-3 recipe suggestions using the provided ingredients
Include estimated cooking time and difficulty level
Provide basic nutritional information (calories, protein, carbs)
Format response as JSON for easy parsing

Example LLM response structure:
json
{
"recipes": [
{
"name": "Garlic Butter Pasta",
"ingredients": ["pasta", "garlic", "butter", "parmesan"],
"instructions": ["Boil pasta...", "Sauté garlic..."],
"cookingTime": "20 minutes",
"difficulty": "Easy",
"nutrition": {
"calories": 450,
"protein": "12g",
"carbs": "60g"
}
}
]
}
